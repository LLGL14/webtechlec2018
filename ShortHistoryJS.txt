Beginning of JavaScript
Netscape communication Corporation, the pre – owner of Netscape Communicator, they were seeking for the way to expanding web. They have developed JavaScript May to December 1995. Main purpose of expanding is ‘dynamic web’

JavaScript at the time was named as ‘mocha’, pushed my Sun Microsystems due to java isn’t suit for those who mocha aimed: scripters, amateurs, designers because java isn’t made for that lightweight tasks.
 
Major Design Features
-JAVA-like syntax
-Functions as First-Class Objects

ECMAScript: JavaScript as a Standard. Current version is 7, it becomes more like general purposed language.
 
AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, born in the years of ECAMScript3. It wasn’t standard and just pushed by microsoft since IE5.
